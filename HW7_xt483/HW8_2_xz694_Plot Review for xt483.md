### My Review:
I like that the choices of two different colors: big contrast, and very bright. I personally don't like the curved axes, as they add some distortion to the look of the plot, and it makes it difficult to locate the X and Y values for a certain datapoint.

The two sine waves appear to be three-dimensional, but it wasn't clear whether it is or not, and if it was, why it was three-dimensional.

It is good that the labels for both axes have their units noted and that there are legends. But without much explanation or context given, the legends for "exp" and "log" are not that clear, even if they might mean exponent and log, but it is not immediatly clear what they really are, and what their values communicate.

A caption to the plot will help explain things a lot, introducing what is in the plot, and what conclusions are drawn.
