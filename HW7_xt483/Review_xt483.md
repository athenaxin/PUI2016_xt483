## Review

My first impression about this plot is that I find it attractive, simple but probably not functional. Studying Dr. Bianco's lecture, I found some points I want to expose about this plot.

Good points:
- Ticks and font size of ticks are appropriate
- Well located legend
- The plot look good at first sight

Attention points:
- The first thing I looked for when I saw the plot the first time is the **caption**. I without help can't tell what is represented in this plot, because I have not enough background on it issue.
- Probably the x and y label are incorrect. If you are aiming to represent in y label volts represented by units v, it shoud be **"volts (v)"**, the way it is represented on plot (volts/v) can lead to a general conclusion that the axis is representing volts divided by v (that it's not clear what variable it is). The same comment apply to x axis, and time/s.
- Distraction / distortion: there's no need on using not straight axis
- By Tufte rules: I could notice some 'Chart Junk' - the excessive and unnecessary use of graphical effects
- A good example about the last point is: Remove to improve - http://i.imgur.com/RzYaLZg.gif

**General comment:** the plot do it's job by representing what it are made to represent, but it has a little bit of extra and not needed informations, specially on the trying to make it visually more interesting. The axis labels can lead to a confusing interpretation about what it is representing, and finally, there's no caption to explain what it is trying to represent and what interesting can be observed on this plot.
