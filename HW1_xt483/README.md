About assignment 1 and 2

1.Following professor' s guide-githubCreateRepoCmds.md help me figure out basic operations in my command line. Actually, I could not get access to my command line and was really confused due to the lack of such knowledge. However, I googled it and asked my classmates Yao Wang to solve it. After trying a lot the codes, I'm familiar with how to create a repository and how to commit changes to files: emacs....git add... git commit -m "commit changes'....git push.... Also, forking my friends is really interesting. I can modify their files' code and then merge our works by pulling requests. 



2.After googling and seeking advice from Yao Wang, I know that setting up an environment variable is about firstly writing below codes:
  Vi   ~/.bashrc
  PUI2016="/home/cusp/xt483/PUI2016_xt483"
  alias pui2016="cd $PUI2016"

and then shown as the screenshot below:

Actually, github is a little complex sometimes, I may upload my changes in a file yesterday, but today I could not. And I met with a problem that my HW1 folder could not be opened in the github website. At last, I googled a lot and find out I need to remove some files and create my dictionary HW1_xt483 and README.md again.  In the process, I also thanked my friend Yuan Shi who helped me google the problem. 

3.Although this assignment is hard, I'm trying to figure out it.
