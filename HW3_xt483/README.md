
Most parts of assignments are done by myself because I want to figure out how to do each part even though sometimes it's too hard to accomplish all the tasks. I tried to ask my classmates as mentioned below for a while. Thanks their kind help very much.

HW1
For the assignment one, I almost follow up the skeleton notebook so I learn how to do the other distributions.

HW2
At first, I did not understand the example code which helps to get the file. So then I turned to Xinshi Zheng(xz1845) for help. He explained to me about the stringIO and how to deal with the zip file. I also turned to Yao Wang(yw2808) to try to plot a duration_range but it's difficult to do it.

HW3
Thanks for the slides and the given information, I figure out how to do the z-test. I also google some materials about it. 


Last but not least, thanks professor's useful python bootcamp and TA's works.
