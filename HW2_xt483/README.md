About the reading
After reading the materials, I've learnt various kinds of errors, such as Syntax error, runtime error, and semantics errors. Solutions include inserting a print statement, writing simple tests and using a temporary variable, etc. Also, asking code questions involves reading errors and giving all the useful information. Be respectful to someone who helps us.
  
HW1
From HW1, I learn how to read json file and  check out each branch. Also, I've used Json viewer to help me figure out branches. Besides, with the help of wangyao(yw2278), I learnt how to use the sys.argv function.
HW2
Getting some troubles about how to show the 'Onwardcall', I asked wangyao and learnt using the if function and if __name__ == 'main'. Other parts involves the same way as HW1.
